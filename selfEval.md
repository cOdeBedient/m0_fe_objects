# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?  
***It felt good. Mostly these concepts made sense, and the object variable followed naturally from what we have learned so far.***
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?  
***Mostly good, though I think I should take more breaks. I find myself a bit burned out at the end of each session, and often push to finish even when I have the time to slow down. Something to work on for sure!!***
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?  
***I think objects will be huge. It seems like they will have*** **many** ***real world applications!! I think the syntax with the colons and commas will be something I screw up a bunch at first, but hope will become natural as I practice.***
